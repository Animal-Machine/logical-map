# About Logical Map

This web app is similar to a mind mapping software, but with an emphasis on logical deduction.

It allows you to place tiles on a board with a double click, each tile representing a proposition. You can connect them with arrows that represent the material conditional.

In the future, Logical Map will be able to compute truth values based on chosen axioms and logical connectives between propositions.

For now, it is in development. You still can color tiles to represent their truth value (unknown, false or true).

The demo is available [here](https://animal-machine.github.io/logical-map/).

Have fun!
